            <p>SMS messaging was used for the first time on 3 December 1992,[8] when Neil Papworth, a 22-year-old test
                engineer for Sema Group in the UK[9] (now Airwide Solutions),[10] used a personal computer to send the
                text message "Merry Christmas" via the Vodafone network to the phone of Richard Jarvis,[11][12] who was
                at a party in Newbury, Berkshire, which had been organised to celebrate the event. Modern SMS text
                messaging is[by whom?] usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. </p>

        <div class="contains" id="second">
            <p>Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera) also launched SMS text
                messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first
                nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis. GSM was
                allowed[by whom?] in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US
                "Carriers" to use US technology. Hence there is no "development" in the US in mobile messaging service.

            <p>Text messaging is most often used between private mobile phone users, as a substitute for voice calls in
                situations where voice communication is impossible or undesirable (e.g., during a school class or a work
                meeting). Texting is also used to communicate very brief messages, such as informing someone that you
                will be late or reminding a friend or colleague about a meeting. As with e-mail, informality and brevity
                have become an accepted part of text messaging.</p>
